# Integration & Testing Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will help you integrate and test the ROI Withdrawal Management system.

---

## 1. Verify Installation

### Check Files Exist
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd c:\Users\USER\Desktop\luxyield-main

# Verify new file exists
ls server/routes/admin/withdrawalManagement.js

# Should output: withdrawalManagement.js
```

### Check admin.js Registration
```bash
grep -n "withdrawalManagement" server/routes/admin.js

# Should output line with: router.use('/withdrawals', require('./admin/withdrawalManagement'));
```

---

## 2. Start Your Server

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Or with nodemon for development
npm run dev
```

Check for errors in console. Server should start without issues.

---

## 3. Test Basic Endpoints

### Using cURL (Command Line)

#### Get Admin Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "adminpassword"}'

# Save the token from response
TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"
```

#### List Withdrawals
```bash
TOKEN="your_token_here"

curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Should return list of withdrawals
```

#### Get Single Withdrawal
```bash
WITHDRAWAL_ID="some_withdrawal_id"
TOKEN="your_token_here"

curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/$WITHDRAWAL_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Should return withdrawal details
```

---

## 4. Test Rejection Flow

### Step 1: Create Test Withdrawal

First, create a withdrawal request as a user:

```javascript
// As a user, create withdrawal request
const withdrawalRequest = {
  amount: 1000,
  currency: "USDT",
  network: "ERC20",
  address: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc2e0c63DD45e9",
  pin: "123456"
};

// POST /api/withdrawal
// This creates a withdrawal with status: "pending"
```

### Step 2: Reject the Withdrawal

```bash
WITHDRAWAL_ID="withdrawal_id_from_above"
TOKEN="admin_token"

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/$WITHDRAWAL_ID/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Insufficient documentation"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Withdrawal rejected. Amount remains in user's locked balance.",
  "withdrawal": {
    "_id": "...",
    "amount": 1000,
    "status": "rejected",
    "type": "roi",
    "rejectionReason": "Insufficient documentation"
  },
  "userBalance": {
    "lockedBalance": 1000,
    "availableBalance": 5000
  }
}
```

### Verify in Database

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
use luxyield_db;  // or your database name

// Check withdrawal status
db.withdrawals.findOne({_id: ObjectId("withdrawal_id")})

// Should show:
// status: "rejected"
// rejectionReason: "Insufficient documentation"

// Check user balance
db.users.findOne({_id: ObjectId("user_id")})

// Should show:
// lockedBalance: 1000
// availableBalance: 5000
```

---

## 5. Test Move to Available

### Step 1: Move Rejected Withdrawal to Available

```bash
WITHDRAWAL_ID="rejection_withdrawal_id"
TOKEN="admin_token"

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/$WITHDRAWAL_ID/move-to-available \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "feePercent": 5
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Withdrawal moved to available balance! Fee applied: $50.00, Net amount added: $950.00",
  "withdrawal": {
    "_id": "...",
    "amount": 1000,
    "status": "moved_to_available",
    "type": "roi",
    "feeApplied": 50,
    "amountAfterFee": 950
  },
  "userBalance": {
    "lockedBalance": 0,
    "availableBalance": 5950
  }
}
```

### Verify Calculations

```
Original Amount: $1,000
Fee Percent: 5%
Fee Amount: $1,000 × 5% = $50
Net Amount: $1,000 - $50 = $950

User's lockedBalance: $1,000 → $0
User's availableBalance: $5,000 → $5,950
```

✅ $5,000 + $950 = $5,950 ✓
✅ Fee of $50 deducted ✓

---

## 6. Test Direct Accept

### Step 1: Create Another Withdrawal

Create a new withdrawal request (follows same process as test withdrawal).

### Step 2: Accept it Directly

```bash
WITHDRAWAL_ID="pending_withdrawal_id"
TOKEN="admin_token"

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/$WITHDRAWAL_ID/accept \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "feePercent": 2
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Withdrawal accepted! Fee: $10.00, Amount moved to available: $490.00",
  "withdrawal": {
    "_id": "...",
    "amount": 500,
    "status": "completed",
    "type": "roi",
    "feeApplied": 10,
    "amountAfterFee": 490
  },
  "userBalance": {
    "lockedBalance": 0,
    "availableBalance": 6440
  }
}
```

---

## 7. Test Filtering & Pagination

### List by Status

```bash
TOKEN="admin_token"

# Get all rejected withdrawals
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals?status=rejected" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get all completed withdrawals

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get all regular withdrawals
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals?type=regular" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Pagination

```bash
# Get page 2, 10 items per page
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals?page=2&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Response includes pagination info:

#     "limit": 10,
#     "total": 25,
#     "pages": 3
#   }
# }
```

---

## 8. Error Testing

### Error 1: Reject Non-Pending Withdrawal

```bash
# Try to reject a withdrawal that's already rejected
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/$COMPLETED_ID/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "test"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/$ID/move-to-available \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"feePercent": 5}'

# Expected Error:
# {
#   "success": false,
#   "error": "Insufficient locked balance. Required: $2000, Available: $500"
# }
```

### Error 4: Unauthorized (No Admin Token)

```

---

## 9. Audit Log Verification

### Check Audit Logs

```javascript
// In MongoDB
db.auditlogs.find({
  action: {
    $in: ["withdrawal_rejected", "withdrawal_moved_to_available", "withdrawal_accepted"]
  }
}).pretty()

// Should show entries like:

## 14. Troubleshooting

### Issue: Routes not found (404)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check routes are registered in admin.js
grep -n "withdrawalManagement" server/routes/admin.js

# Ensure the file exists
ls server/routes/admin/withdrawalManagement.js

# Check server restarted after changes
# Restart: npm start
```

### Issue: Authentication errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify token is valid
# Get new token from login endpoint
# Include in Authorization header as: "Bearer TOKEN"

# Check admin role is set
db.users.findOne({_id: ObjectId("admin_id")})
# Should have: role: "admin"
```

### Issue: Balance not updating

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check user exists
db.users.findOne({_id: ObjectId("user_id")})

# Check withdrawal exists
db.withdrawals.findOne({_id: ObjectId("withdrawal_id")})

# Verify status is correct for operation
# pending → can reject or accept
# rejected → can move-to-available
# completed/moved_to_available → view only
```

### Issue: Fees not calculated correctly

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Verify formula:
feeAmount = (totalAmount * feePercent) / 100
amountAfterFee = totalAmount - feeAmount

// Example:
// Total: 1000, Fee: 5%
// Fee: (1000 * 5) / 100 = 50
// After: 1000 - 50 = 950 ✓
```

feeAmount = (totalAmount * feePercent) / 100
amountAfterFee = totalAmount - feeAmount

// Example:
// Total: 1000, Fee: 5%
// Fee: (1000 * 5) / 100 = 50
// After: 1000 - 50 = 950 ✓
