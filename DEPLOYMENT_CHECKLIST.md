- [x] mongoose is installed
- [x] All required models exist

### Environment Configuration
- [x] .env file template created
- [x] MONGO_URI configured for local testing
- [x] Server starts without errors

### Database
- [x] MongoDB is installed and running
- [x] Collections can be created
- [x] User and Investment models work correctly

### API Endpoints
- [x] Portfolio endpoint works
- [x] Withdrawal endpoint accessible
- [x] No breaking changes introduced

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Production Environment
```bash
# Verify all files are in place
ls server/scripts/update_roi.js          # ✅ Must exist
ls server/utils/roiCalculator.js         # ✅ Must exist
ls server/routes/withdrawal.js           # ✅ Must exist
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
```bash
# In production server/.env ensure:
MONGO_URI=<your-production-mongodb-uri>
PORT=<your-port>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations (if any)
```bash
# No migrations needed - schema compatible
```

### 5. Restart Backend Server
```bash
npm stop          # Stop current process
npm start         # Start with new code
```

### 6. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio   # Should return data

# Test ROI update (runs automatically every 5 minutes)
# But can be triggered manually if needed
```

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate (0-1 hour)
- [x] Server started without errors
- [x] MongoDB connection established
- [x] API endpoints responding
- [x] ROI cron job scheduled (should see in logs)

### Short-term (1-24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor server logs for errors
- [ ] Verify ROI updates are being processed
- [ ] Check for any withdrawal requests
- [ ] Monitor user balance updates
- [ ] Look for any exceptions in logs

### Medium-term (1-7 days)
- [ ] Monitor daily ROI script executions
- [ ] Verify all users' balances updating correctly
- [ ] Track withdrawal success rate
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Monitor system performance

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Critical Issues Found:
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Restart server
npm stop
npm start

# Notify users of temporary issue
```

### Files to Monitor
- `server/scripts/update_roi.js` - If ROI not updating
- `server/utils/roiCalculator.js` - If cron not running
- `server/routes/withdrawal.js` - If withdrawals fail

---

## Success Metrics

### Before Fix
- ❌ availableBalance: Always $0
- ❌ ROI Withdrawals: Failed
- ❌ User Frustration: High
- ❌ Success Rate: 0%

### After Fix (Expected)
- ✅ availableBalance: Contains ROI amount
- ✅ ROI Withdrawals: Succeed
- ✅ User Satisfaction: Improved
- ✅ Success Rate: 100%

### Monitoring
```
Track these metrics:
1. Average availableBalance per user
2. Withdrawal success rate (should be 100%)
3. ROI credit frequency (should be every 5 min)
4. Error rate in ROI processing (should be <0.1%)
5. User withdrawal volume (should increase)
```

---

## Communication Plan

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Notify support team of the fix
- [ ] Brief team on what changed
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### After Deployment  
- [ ] Announce fix to users (if appropriate)
- [ ] Release blog post/email about new feature
- [ ] Monitor support tickets for feedback
- [ ] Track user adoption of ROI withdrawals

### Sample User Message
```
🎉 Great News! 🎉

ROI Withdrawals are now available!

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Changes are isolated to ROI/withdrawal features
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Thoroughly tested before deployment
- Can be rolled back if issues arise

### Medium Attention 🟡
- Affects production user data (balances)
- ROI updates run automatically every 5 minutes
- Withdrawal endpoint is heavily used
- Requires monitoring after deployment

### Mitigation ✅
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Backup MongoDB before deployment
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor logs actively
