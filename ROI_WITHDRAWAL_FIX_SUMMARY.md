# ROI WITHDRAWAL FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Problem Summary
Users could not withdraw ROI because:
1. ROI was being added to investment `currentValue` and transaction history
2. BUT ROI was **never credited to the user's `availableBalance`**
3. The withdrawal endpoint was checking `depositBalance` instead of `availableBalance`

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: ROI Not Credited to User's Available Balance
**Files Affected:**
- `server/scripts/update_roi.js` - Daily ROI update script
- `server/utils/roiCalculator.js` - ROI simulation cron job (runs every 5 minutes)

**Problem:** Both scripts updated the investment's `currentValue` but didn't update the user's `availableBalance`.

### Issue 2: Withdrawal Using Wrong Balance Field
**File Affected:**
- `server/routes/withdrawal.js`

**Problem:** The withdrawal endpoint checked `user.depositBalance` instead of `user.availableBalance`.

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Update Daily ROI Script
**File:** `server/scripts/update_roi.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `require('dotenv').config()` to load environment variables
- Added `const User = require('../models/User')` 
- After adding ROI transaction to investment, now also credits the ROI amount to user's `availableBalance`:

```javascript
// Credit ROI to user's availableBalance
await User.findByIdAndUpdate(inv.user, { $inc: { availableBalance: roiAmount } });
```

### Solution 2: Update ROI Calculator Cron Job
**File:** `server/utils/roiCalculator.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `const User = require('../models/User')` at the top
- After adding ROI transaction, now credits **positive gains only** to `availableBalance`:

```javascript
// Credit ROI to user's availableBalance (positive gains only)
if (fluctuation > 0) {
  await User.findByIdAndUpdate(invDoc.user, { $inc: { availableBalance: fluctuation } });
}
```

### Solution 3: Fix Withdrawal Endpoint Balance Check
**File:** `server/routes/withdrawal.js`

**Changes:**
- Changed balance check from `user.depositBalance` to `user.availableBalance`
- Changed balance deduction from `user.depositBalance` to `user.availableBalance`

```javascript
// Before:
if (user.depositBalance < requestedAmount) { ... }
user.depositBalance -= requestedAmount;

// After:
if (user.availableBalance < requestedAmount) { ... }
user.availableBalance -= requestedAmount;
```

## Testing Results

### Test Setup
1. Created test user with $5000 locked balance
2. Created test investment with $5000 initial amount
3. Ran ROI update script

### Test Results
✅ **ROI Successfully Credited**
- Initial availableBalance: $0.00
- After ROI update: $2.50
- Investment currentValue: $5002.50
- User can now withdraw the $2.50 ROI

✅ **Withdrawal Endpoint Fixed**
- Now uses `availableBalance` for withdrawal checks
- Users can withdraw any amount up to their `availableBalance`
- ROI is now withdrawable alongside deposits

## How It Works Now

1. **Investment Gains ROI** (via cron job or daily script):
   - Investment `currentValue` increases
   - ROI transaction is added to investment history
   - User's `availableBalance` is incremented by the ROI amount

2. **User Checks Portfolio**:
   - Portfolio API shows updated `availableBalance` including ROI
   - User can see how much they can withdraw

3. **User Requests Withdrawal**:
   - Withdrawal endpoint checks `availableBalance`
   - If available, creates withdrawal record and deducts from `availableBalance`
   - Withdrawal is processed

## Deployment Steps

1. Push code changes:
   - `server/scripts/update_roi.js`
   - `server/utils/roiCalculator.js`
   - `server/routes/withdrawal.js`

2. Restart backend server to apply changes

3. ROI will automatically be credited going forward

## Verification Command

```bash
cd server
node scripts/verify_roi_fix.js
```

This will show user balances and confirm ROI withdrawal is working.
