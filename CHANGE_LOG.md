# 📋 COMPLETE CHANGE LOG - ROI WITHDRAWAL FIX

## Executive Summary
Fixed critical issue where users couldn't withdraw ROI because it wasn't being credited to their available balance. Three code paths fixed, comprehensive testing completed, full documentation provided.

---

## 🔧 Code Changes

### 1. server/scripts/update_roi.js
**Purpose:** Daily automated ROI update script
**Issue:** Was not crediting ROI to user's availableBalance

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added: Load environment variables
+ require('dotenv').config();

// Added: Import User model
+ const User = require('../models/User');

// Added: Credit ROI to availableBalance after each ROI transaction
+ await User.findByIdAndUpdate(inv.user, { 
+   $inc: { availableBalance: roiAmount } 
+ });

// Modified: Updated console message to indicate balance credit
- console.log(`Updated investment ${inv._id} for user ${inv.user}: +${roiAmount.toFixed(2)} ROI`);
+ console.log(`Updated investment ${inv._id} for user ${inv.user}: +${roiAmount.toFixed(2)} ROI (credited to availableBalance)`);
```

**Impact:** Daily ROI updates now credit user balances

---

### 2. server/utils/roiCalculator.js
**Purpose:** ROI simulator cron job (runs every 5 minutes)
**Issue:** Was not crediting gains to user's availableBalance

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added: Import User model at top
+ const User = require('../models/User');

// Added: Credit positive gains to availableBalance
+ // Credit ROI to user's availableBalance (positive gains only)
+ if (fluctuation > 0) {
+   await User.findByIdAndUpdate(invDoc.user, { 
+     $inc: { availableBalance: fluctuation } 
+   });
+ }
```

**Impact:** ROI cron job now credits user balances for gains

---

### 3. server/routes/withdrawal.js
**Purpose:** Withdrawal endpoint
**Issue:** Was checking/deducting from wrong balance field (depositBalance instead of availableBalance)

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Changed: Balance check
- if (user.depositBalance < requestedAmount) {
+ if (user.availableBalance < requestedAmount) {
  return res.status(400).json({ msg: 'Insufficient balance for withdrawal.' });
}

// Changed: Balance deduction
- user.depositBalance -= requestedAmount;
+ user.availableBalance -= requestedAmount;
```

**Impact:** Withdrawals now use correct balance field that includes ROI
