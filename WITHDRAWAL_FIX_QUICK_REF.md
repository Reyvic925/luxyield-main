# Empty Server Response Error - FIXED ✓

## Quick Summary
**Error**: "Failed to withdraw ROI: Empty server response (verification failed)."
**Cause**: Response middleware context binding issue in server.js
**Fix**: Changed `.bind(res)` to `.call(this, data)` pattern
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to production (commit 227d11c)

## What Changed
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `res.json.bind(res)` | `const originalJson = res.json` |
| `originalJson(data)` | `originalJson.call(this, data)` |
| **Result**: Empty response | **Result**: Full JSON response |

## User Experience
### Before Fix
```
User clicks "Withdraw ROI" → Error toast → No withdrawal
```

### After Fix
```
User clicks "Withdraw ROI" → Success toast → Funds locked pending approval
```

## Technical Impact
✅ Fixes `/api/investment/withdraw-roi/:investmentId` empty responses
✅ Fixes admin approval endpoint response forwarding  
✅ Improves all Express JSON response handling
✅ Maintains backward compatibility
✅ No breaking changes

## Deployment Status
- **Commit**: 227d11c
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Deployed to production
- **Requires**: Server restart (automatic on Render)

## Verification
After deployment, users can:
1. Navigate to completed investments
2. Click "Withdraw ROI"
3. See success message with ROI amount
4. Check Withdraw page for locked balance update

## Support
If users still experience issues:
1. Verify they're on the latest frontend (hard refresh)
2. Check server logs for any 500 errors
3. Confirm user token is valid and not expired
4. Test with different browser in incognito mode
