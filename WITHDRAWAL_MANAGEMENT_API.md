# ROI Withdrawal Rejection and Balance Management System

## Overview

This system provides admins with complete control over ROI (Return on Investment) withdrawals with a three-step workflow:

1. **REJECT** - Admin rejects a withdrawal request, amount stays in user's locked balance
2. **MOVE TO AVAILABLE** - Admin moves the rejected amount to user's available balance (with optional fee)
3. **ACCEPT** - Admin accepts a pending withdrawal and moves it to available balance (with optional fee)

## Complete Workflow Example

### Scenario: User requests $1000 ROI withdrawal

**Step 1: User creates withdrawal request**
- User balance before: availableBalance: $5000, lockedBalance: $0
- Withdrawal amount: $1000
- Status: `pending`

**Step 2: Admin rejects the withdrawal**
```bash
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/{withdrawalId}/reject
{
  "reason": "Needs more documentation"
}
```
- Withdrawal status: `rejected`
- User balance: availableBalance: $5000, lockedBalance: $1000 (stays here)

**Step 3: Admin moves to available with 5% fee**
```bash
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/{withdrawalId}/move-to-available
{
  "feePercent": 5
}
```
- Fee taken: $50
- Amount to available: $950
- Withdrawal status: `moved_to_available`
- User balance: availableBalance: $5950, lockedBalance: $0

**Result:**
- User receives $950 in available balance
- Platform keeps $50 as fee
- User can now use $950 in available balance for new investments

---

## Balance Fields

### User Model Balance Fields
```javascript
{
  availableBalance: 5000,    // Money user can withdraw or use for new investments
  lockedBalance: 1000,       // Money locked from rejected withdrawals or in-progress ROI
  balance: 6000              // Total balance (legacy field, use availableBalance + lockedBalance)
}
```

### Withdrawal Model Status Values
- `pending` - Initial status, awaiting admin review
- `rejected` - Admin rejected, amount stays in lockedBalance
- `moved_to_available` - Admin moved to available balance (with or without fee)
- `completed` - Admin accepted, withdrawal processed
- `failed` - Withdrawal failed during processing

---

## Audit Logging

All withdrawal actions are automatically logged in the AuditLog collection with:
- Admin ID performing the action
- User ID affected
- Action type (withdrawal_rejected, withdrawal_moved_to_available, withdrawal_accepted)
- Complete transaction details (amounts, fees, balances)
- Timestamp

**Example Audit Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "userId": "63d9a8b7c6f5e4d3c2b1a0z9",
  "adminId": "63d9a8b7c6f5e4d3c2b1a0z9",
  "action": "withdrawal_moved_to_available",
  "details": {
    "withdrawalId": "64a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1",
    "amount": 1000,
    "fee": 50,
    "amountAfterFee": 950,
    "previousLockedBalance": 1000,
    "newLockedBalance": 0,
    "newAvailableBalance": 5950
  },
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**1. Withdrawal Not Found**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Withdrawal not found"
}
```

**2. Invalid Status Transition**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Can only move rejected withdrawals. Current status: pending"
}
```

**3. Insufficient Locked Balance**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Insufficient locked balance. Required: $1000, Available: $500"
}
```

**4. Unauthorized Access**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Admin authentication required"
}
```

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Fee Handling:** Fees are optional (default 0%). They reduce the amount transferred to available balance.
2. **Audit Trail:** All transactions are logged for compliance and reconciliation.
3. **Balance Integrity:** The system maintains balance consistency through transaction-based updates.
4. **ROI Tracking:** For ROI withdrawals, the associated investment is marked as `roiWithdrawn: true`.
