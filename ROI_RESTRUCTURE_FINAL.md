# ✅ ROI WITHDRAWAL RESTRUCTURE - FINAL SUMMARY (Feb 17, 2026)

## What You Requested

You asked for the ROI withdrawal logic to work like this:

> **"The ROI should NOT be credited to the available balance directly, it should be credited to the current value in the investment details. When the admin ends the investment or it ends by itself, the user can now withdraw the current balance and it will move to the locked balance. Which the admin can move the money from locked balance to available balance when he likes."**

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All code has been updated to implement your requested flow. Here's what was done:

---

## 🔄 The New Workflow

### Phase 1: Investment Active
- ✅ ROI accumulates in `investment.currentValue`
- ✅ ROI **NOT credited to availableBalance**
- ✅ User sees ROI in investment details

**Code Updated:** `server/scripts/update_roi.js` and `server/utils/roiCalculator.js`

### Phase 2: Investment Ends (Auto)
- ✅ When `endDate` passes, investment auto-completes
- ✅ **Entire `currentValue` moves to `user.lockedBalance`**
- ✅ Investment marked as `status: 'completed'`

**Code Updated:** `server/scripts/update_roi.js` and `server/utils/roiCalculator.js`

### Phase 3: User Withdraws ROI
- ✅ User clicks "Withdraw ROI" on completed investment
- ✅ Creates withdrawal request (stays in `lockedBalance`)
- ✅ Awaits admin approval

**Code Already Working:** `server/routes/investment.js`

### Phase 4: Admin Approves
- ✅ Admin reviews withdrawal request
- ✅ Admin clicks "Approve"
- ✅ **Moves from `lockedBalance` → `availableBalance`**
- ✅ Optional fee deduction

**Code Already Working:** `server/routes/admin.js`

### Phase 5: Admin Manual Release (NEW)
- ✅ Admin can manually move funds without withdrawal request
- ✅ Useful for quick approvals

**Code Added:** `server/routes/admin.js` - `POST /admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds`

---

## 📁 Files Changed

### 1. `server/scripts/update_roi.js` ✅
**What Changed:**
```javascript
// REMOVED: await User.findByIdAndUpdate(inv.user, { $inc: { availableBalance: roiAmount } });

// ADDED: Auto-complete ended investments
const endedInvestments = await Investment.find({ status: 'active', endDate: { $lte: today } });
for (const inv of endedInvestments) {
  inv.status = 'completed';
  await User.findByIdAndUpdate(inv.user, { $inc: { lockedBalance: inv.currentValue } });
}
```

### 2. `server/utils/roiCalculator.js` ✅
**What Changed:**
```javascript
// REMOVED: if (fluctuation > 0) { await User.findByIdAndUpdate(...availableBalance...); }

// ADDED: When matured, move to lockedBalance
if (minutesLeft <= 0) {
  invDoc.status = 'completed';
  const currentValue = invDoc.currentValue;
  await User.findByIdAndUpdate(invDoc.user, { $inc: { lockedBalance: currentValue } });
}
```

### 3. `server/routes/admin.js` ✅
**What Added:**
```javascript
// NEW ENDPOINT: Release locked funds to available
POST /api/admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds
Body: { amount: 1000, reason: "Investment completed" }
```

---

## 💰 User Balance Behavior

### Available Balance
- Money user can **immediately withdraw** to crypto
- Only grows when admin releases from locked

### Locked Balance
- Money **pending admin action**
- Grows when investments complete
- Grows when users request ROI withdrawal
- Decreases when admin approves release

### Investment CurrentValue
- **Primary place ROI accumulates**
- Never goes directly to availableBalance
- Moves entire amount to lockedBalance when investment ends

---

## 🎯 Example Scenario

```
1. User invests: $5,000
   Available: $0 | Locked: $0 | Investment: $5,000

2. After 7 days (auto-complete):
   Available: $0 | Locked: $5,750 | Investment: (completed)
   
3. User requests ROI withdrawal:
   Available: $0 | Locked: $5,750 | Withdrawal: pending
   
4. Admin approves:
   Available: $750 | Locked: $5,000 | Withdrawal: confirmed
   
5. User withdraws to crypto:
   Available: $0 | Locked: $5,000 | Crypto: received
```

---

## 🎮 Admin Capabilities

### Approve ROI Withdrawal
```
POST /api/admin/roi-withdrawals/:id/accept
Body: { feePercent: 5 }
Result: Moves from locked to available (with optional fee)
```

### Reject ROI Withdrawal
```
POST /api/admin/roi-withdrawals/:id/reject
Body: { reason: "Pending verification" }
Result: Amount stays in locked, user can retry
```

### Manual Release (NEW)
```
POST /api/admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds
Body: { amount: 5750, reason: "Investment matured" }
Result: Instantly moves to available without withdrawal request
```

## ✨ Key Differences

### OLD SYSTEM
```
Investment earns ROI
        ↓
ROI immediately goes to availableBalance
        ↓
User can withdraw instantly
```

### NEW SYSTEM (YOUR REQUEST)
```
Investment earns ROI
        ↓
ROI stays in investment.currentValue
        ↓
Investment ends → Move entire amount to lockedBalance
        ↓
User requests withdrawal → Amount stays locked
        ↓
Admin approves → Move to availableBalance
        ↓
User can now withdraw
```
