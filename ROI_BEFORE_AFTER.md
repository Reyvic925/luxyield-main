```javascript
// User clicks "Withdraw ROI"
// System does:
const roi = investment.currentValue - investment.amount;  // 750
investment.currentValue -= roi;                           // 5000
investment.roiWithdrawn = true;
user.lockedBalance += roi;                                // 750
// Done! Awaiting admin approval only.

## Data Model Impact

### Investment Document

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
{
  currentValue: 5750,      // Holds ROI until explicitly handled
  roiWithdrawn: false,
  status: "completed"
}
```

**AFTER ✨:**
```javascript
{
  currentValue: 5000,      // ROI removed immediately when user withdraws
  roiWithdrawn: true,      // Clear flag
  status: "completed",
  transactions: [
    { type: 'withdrawal', amount: 750, description: 'ROI Withdrawal' }
  ]
}
```

### User Balance

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
{
  availableBalance: 0,
  lockedBalance: 0,        // Nothing here until admin action
  // Unclear where ROI is
}
```

**AFTER ✨:**
```javascript
{
  availableBalance: 0,
  lockedBalance: 750,      // ROI here immediately after withdrawal
  // Clear: ROI locked, awaiting approval
}
```

    roiWithdrawn: true
  },
  lockedBalance: 750       // Shows where ROI is!
