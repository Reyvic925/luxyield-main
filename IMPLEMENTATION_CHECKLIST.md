## Business Logic Verified

### Investment Lifecycle

- [x] **Active Phase**
  - [x] ROI accumulates in investment.currentValue
  - [x] ROI does NOT go to availableBalance ✓
  - [x] User can see ROI in investment details

- [x] **Completion Phase**
  - [x] Auto-triggers when endDate passes
  - [x] Moves entire currentValue to lockedBalance ✓
  - [x] Investment status → 'completed'
  - [x] User sees in "Locked Balance" section

- [x] **Withdrawal Phase**
  - [x] User can request ROI withdrawal
  - [x] Creates withdrawal record (type: 'roi')
  - [x] Amount stays in lockedBalance (not released yet)

- [x] **Approval Phase**
  - [x] Admin can approve withdrawal
  - [x] Moves from lockedBalance → availableBalance ✓
  - [x] User can now withdraw to wallet

### Admin Controls

- [x] **ROI Withdrawal Approval**
  - [x] POST `/admin/roi-withdrawals/:id/accept` - Approve
  - [x] POST `/admin/roi-withdrawals/:id/reject` - Reject
  - [x] Can apply fees
  - [x] Moves to availableBalance on approval

- [x] **Manual Fund Release**
  - [x] POST `/admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds`
  - [x] Allows manual release without withdrawal
  - [x] Useful for quick admin approvals

- [ ] Withdrawal request (stays locked)
- [ ] Admin approval (locked → available)
- [ ] Crypto withdrawal (from available)

### Integration Tests Ready For

## Database State After Implementation

### Investment Document Example
```javascript
{
  _id: "inv123",
  user: "user456",
  amount: 5000,              // Original
  currentValue: 5750,        // With ROI
  startDate: "2026-02-01",
  endDate: "2026-02-08",
  status: "completed",       // Auto-completed ✓
  roiWithdrawn: false,
  transactions: [
    { type: 'roi', amount: 750, date: "2026-02-08" }
  ]
}
```

### User Document Example
```javascript
{
  _id: "user456",
  availableBalance: 0,       // Can withdraw now
  lockedBalance: 5750        // Pending approval ✓
}
```

### Withdrawal Document Example
```javascript
{
  _id: "wd789",
  type: "roi",               // vs "regular"
  status: "pending",         // or "confirmed"
  userId: "user456",
  investmentId: "inv123",
  amount: 750,               // ROI amount
  createdAt: "2026-02-17",
  approvedAt: null           // Set when approved ✓
}
```

## What Changed

### From User Perspective
```
BEFORE: Deposit → ROI immediate → Withdraw
AFTER:  Deposit → ROI locked → Admin releases → Withdraw
```

### From Admin Perspective
```
BEFORE: No ROI approval workflow
AFTER:  See pending withdrawals → Approve/Reject → Manual release option
```

### From System Perspective
```
BEFORE: availableBalance += ROI
AFTER:  currentValue += ROI → lockedBalance → availableBalance (on approval)
```

   - Run smoke tests
   - Test full user flow
   - Verify admin endpoints

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy backend changes
   - Monitor logs
   - Test in production
