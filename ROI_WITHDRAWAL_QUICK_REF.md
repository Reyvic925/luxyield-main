| Withdraw to Wallet | `POST /api/withdrawal` | Wallet details | Deducts from availableBalance |

### Admin Actions

|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Approve ROI Withdrawal | `POST /api/admin/roi-withdrawals/:id/accept` | `{ feePercent: 0 }` | Locked → Available |

## Code Changes Summary

### File 1: `server/scripts/update_roi.js`
```
OLD: availableBalance += roiAmount
NEW: Keep in investment.currentValue

OLD: Only updated active investments
NEW: Also auto-completes ended investments
     and moves to lockedBalance
```

### File 2: `server/utils/roiCalculator.js`
```
OLD: availableBalance += fluctuation
NEW: Keep in investment.currentValue

OLD: Only status update to completed
NEW: Also moves to lockedBalance
     when investment matures
```

### File 3: `server/routes/admin.js`
```
NEW: POST /admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds
     → Moves from locked to available
```

---

## Key Differences

### ❌ OLD SYSTEM
```
Investment active → ROI credited to availableBalance
                 ↓
             User withdraws immediately
```

### ✅ NEW SYSTEM
```
Investment active → ROI stays in investment
                 ↓
         Investment ends → Move to lockedBalance
                 ↓
       User requests withdrawal → Still locked
                 ↓
      Admin approves → Move to availableBalance
                 ↓
          User withdraws
```

## User Experience

### Before (Old System)
1. ✓ Invest $5,000
2. ✓ ROI shows in availableBalance immediately
3. ✓ Can withdraw ROI anytime
4. ✗ Less admin control
5. ✗ No approval process

### After (New System)
1. ✓ Invest $5,000
2. ✓ See ROI growing in investment details
3. ✗ ROI NOT in availableBalance (new behavior)
4. ✓ Investment completes → Moved to locked balance
5. ✓ Request withdrawal → Admin approves
6. ✓ After approval → Moves to available
7. ✓ Then can withdraw to wallet
8. ✓ Full admin control and audit trail

```

### Find user's locked funds:
```javascript
User.findById(userId).select('lockedBalance')
```
